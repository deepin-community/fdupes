Installing fdupes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You're looking at a DEVELOPMENT version of fdupes. If you're not a software
developer or you just want to install the program, this is probably not the
version you want. This version of fdupes is currently in development and
subject to change. The features and functionality present in this version
may not reflect the features and functionality in the final release.

The easiest way to install fdupes is to use your operating system's package
manager, if available. If that's not an option or you'd prefer to compile
the program yourself (which may sometimes be the only way to obtain the
latest version), you should download a RELEASE version of fdupes and follow
the installation instructions provided with it.

As of this writing, fdupes releases may be downloaded from:

	https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes/releases

If you're a programmer and you wish to use or work on this version of fdupes
you will need to install autoconf and automake on your system and run

	autoreconf --install

to generate the configure script and other files needed for compilation and
installation. After that you may compile fdupes by running:

	./configure
	make

and install it by running:

	sudo make install
